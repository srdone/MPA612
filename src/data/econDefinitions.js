    title: 'Natural Monopoly',
    description: `Monopolies that arise naturally because it is more cost-effective for a single
      producer to produce the entire output. This most often occurs when the producer experiences
      diminishing marginal cost, often nearing zero, after a large up-front investment`

    title: 'Kaldor-Hicks efficiency',
    description: `Resource allocation that makes some better off and some worse off, but the net
      benefits are positive. Theoretically, the gainers could fully compensate the losers so that
      at least one person is better off and no person is worse off.`

    description: `A situation where the market equilibrium is not efficient.

  {
    title: 'Non-rival',
    description: `Goods with the characteristic that one person's consumption of the good does not
      diminish another person's ability to consume the good. An example of this is radio - If I tune in
      to a radio station, it does not prevent anyone else from tuning in to the same station.`
  },
  {
    title: 'Non-exclusive',
    description: `Goods with the characteristic that it is practically impossible to exclude others

    description: `A result of imperfect information where buyers and sellers have different (asymmetric) information.
      Traders with information that others do not have selectively participate in the market. An example
      of this is in the individual health insurance market where individuals have more information about
      their own health than insurers do, leading those with low health risk to choose not to participate
      in the market for health insurance as rates rise, which causes rates to rise further.`

    title: 'Moral hazard',
    description: `When one person takes additional risks because someone other than themself
      bears the costs of those risks. An example would be someone who is less careful with their
      phone when they have accident replacement insurance.`

    title: 'Principal agent problem',
    description: `When one person is able to make decisions for another person, and those
      people have different incentives. An example would be a real-estate agent who may be more
